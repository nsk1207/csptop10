## Our Team Manifesto

Our manifesto will be the overarching principles that we need as a team to be successful. It is as follows: 

COMMUNICATION over COMPLETION: Things can easily be completed without communicating. However, this creates uncoordinated work, can cause individuals to do unecessary work, and can impact the general quality of the work completed. As a team, we will prioritize talking about our goals and the work we mean to complete over completing it as fast as possible without talking about what we all need to do.

LEARNING over LABOR: although it is obviously important to complete work, it is more important that we as individuals actually understand the work we are doing and why we are doing it so that we can recreate it in the future. Therefore, our team will spend time making sure that everyone actually understands the processes involved in the creation of our website to increase our capability and expertise.

ASKING FOR HELP over DOING IT YOURSELF: Although it is important for team members to be problem solvers and to complete their own work, it is important that members feel as though they are able to ask for help and don't have to struggle alone. This will strengthen team bonds and allow for a more put together website.
