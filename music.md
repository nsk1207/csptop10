# Top 10 Albums of 2022
The top 10 best Hip Hop albums released in 2022!
### 10) Her Loss - Drake & 21 Savage
Drake and 21 Savage collab for an album full of banging trap instrumentals and witty bars. 
### 9) SICK! - Earl Sweatshirt
With extremely disjointed production and odd flows, Earl manages to create a very unique listening experience.
### 8) HERBERT - Ab-Soul
Although this project may not be as dense and conceptual as his previous work, this album is packed with hard hitting bars and good beats.
### 7) It's Almost Dry - Pusha T
Backed by quality production from both Pharrell and Ye, Push delivers a solid follow-up to DAYTONA.
### 6) Metro Boomin - Heroes and Villains
Coming out just before the new year, Heroes and Villains is full of trap bangers to vibe out too. 
### 5) 2000 - Joey Bada$$ 
2000 is a very interesting record, as it picks up where 1999 (his debut mixtape) left off. With lots of smooth, boom bap beats, he doesn't do anything entirely new, however he does what he does really well.
### 4) Drill Music in Zion - Lupe Fiasco
Lupe's new album consists of a fairly short runtime, however most of what he says sticks. 
### 3) Melt My Eyez See Your Future - Denzel Curry
A complete stylistic 180 for Denzel, he switches up from his normal, very abrasive trap sound to a more mellow, mature sound that he uses in order to look within himself.
### 2) The Forever Story - JID
JID's sequel to his debut album, The Never Story. A very introspective album with a very unique set of beats. Every track hits, and the new added track 2007 is really the icing on the cake.
### 1) Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers - Kendrick Lamar
Kendrick's long awaited return to music! A very beefy double album that disucsses his personal growth throughout his 5 year hiatus.
